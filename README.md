# Channel Crossings Tracker

A one-page site showing how many people cross the English Channel in small boats each day, using the Home Office's provisional daily figures.

## Files

- `index.html` – the page
- `privacy.html` – the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, linked from the page footer
- `favicon.svg` – the CC logo shown in the browser tab
- `apple-touch-icon.png` – the icon used when someone adds the site to their iPhone home screen
- `logo-badge.png` – the full Channel Crossings badge, for your X profile and elsewhere
- `og-image.png` – the preview picture X shows when someone shares the link; redrawn whenever new figures are published
- `scripts/og_image.py` – draws `og-image.png`
- `data.json` – the full daily history, loaded by the homepage
- `recent.json` – the last 90 days and totals, used by the embed widget
- `status.json` – a tiny heartbeat written at every check, so open pages know when the site last looked and when to fetch new figures
- `gender.json`, `nationalities.json`, `perboat.json`, `returns.json`, `petitions.json` – sex and age, nationalities, people per boat, UK–France returns and related petitions, all gathered automatically by `scripts/extras.py`
- `requirements.txt` – the Python packages the update job installs
- `data.csv` – the same daily figures as a spreadsheet download, linked from the footer
- `how-it-works.html` – where the figures come from
- `embed.html` – the small "latest figure" box other sites can embed
- `studio.js`, `studio.css` – Studio, the paid fourth tab: every graph in six styles and many chart forms, unlocked for £1.99; loaded only when the tab opens
- `scripts/studio-worker.js` – the Cloudflare Worker behind Studio's accounts and payments (an account is an email address; Stripe is the only record of who has paid)
- `404.html` – shown for any address that doesn't exist (including the retired beta, classic and Beach Radar pages); sends visitors to the homepage
- `sw.js` – offline mode: keeps a copy of the site on visitors' devices
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` – help search engines find and index the site
- `week-card.png` – the "Week in numbers" picture, redrawn daily for the last full week
- `manifest.webmanifest`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` – let visitors add the site to their home screen as an app
- Report Channel Crossing (the eye button) is a private form sent through Web3Forms; the access key `RS_KEY` in `index.html` decides which inbox reports go to
- `vendor/inter/`, `vendor/inter-tight/` – the Inter and Inter Tight fonts (SIL Open Font License), used on every device: Inter for text, Inter Tight for headings and big figures
- `scripts/update.py` – fetches the latest figures from GOV.UK and updates `data.json`
- `scripts/news.py`, `news.json`, `.github/workflows/news.yml` – breaking news about small boats from UK news feeds, every 15 minutes (create `news-override.json` to hide or pin a story)
- `scripts/build-towns.js`, `towns.json` – the extra town names on the homepage map (GeoNames, CC BY 4.0), shown more as you zoom in; rebuilt by hand, not on a schedule
- `scripts/facebook.py`, `fb.json` – posts each day's figures to the Facebook Page once they're published (needs the `FB_PAGE_ID` and `FB_PAGE_TOKEN` secrets; `fb.json` remembers the last day posted)
- `scripts/vessels.py`, `vessels.json` – every 15 minutes, the positions of lifeboats, Border Force, navy ships and rescue aircraft in the Strait from live AIS, drawn on the map (needs the free `AISSTREAM_KEY` secret from [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/))
- `scripts/tg_login.py` – run once by hand to make the `TG_SESSION` secret; with `TG_API_ID`, `TG_API_HASH` and `TG_SESSION` set, `news.py` reads the live sightings channels through Telegram's API
- `.github/workflows/vessels.yml` – runs `scripts/vessels.py` every 15 minutes
- `3c699a48e42e6f3a4c6573138dd6fc80.txt` – the IndexNow key; `update.py` pings search engines with it when new figures arrive, so keep it
- `CNAME` – the custom domain, channelcrossings.world
- `vendor/leaflet/` – the Leaflet map library (BSD licence)
- `.github/workflows/update.yml` and `scripts/gate.py` – from 12 noon UK time, check for new figures every 15 minutes until they're in, then stop until noon the next day

## Put it online with GitHub Pages

1. Create a new **public** repository on GitHub.
2. Upload everything in this folder, keeping the folder structure (including the `.github` folder).
   On a Mac, press Cmd+Shift+. in Finder to see the hidden `.github` folder.
3. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select `main` and `/ (root)`, and save.
4. Go to **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, select **Read and write permissions**, and save.
5. Go to the **Actions** tab, open **Update crossing figures**, and click **Run workflow** once to load the full history.

The site expects to be served from the root of its own domain (set in `CNAME`): the sitemap, robots.txt, canonical links and IndexNow all name channelcrossings.world, and `404.html` sends visitors to `/`. After that, the figures update themselves every day.

## About the data

Source: [Small boat activity in the English Channel](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/migrants-detected-crossing-the-english-channel-in-small-boats) (Home Office, Open Government Licence v3.0). Figures are provisional and can be revised. The daily page covers the last 7 days; the time-series spreadsheet, updated on Fridays, goes back to 2018.

## Studio: switching on payments

Studio shows its offer straight away, but the Unlock button stays off until the worker is running. To switch it on:

1. **Stripe.** Make an account at stripe.com and stay in **test mode** to start. Copy the secret key (`sk_test_…`) from Developers → API keys.
2. **Resend.** Make an account at resend.com, add `channelcrossings.world` under Domains and add the DNS records it shows at your domain provider, then create an API key.
3. **Cloudflare.** Make a free account, go to Workers & Pages → Create → Worker, paste in `scripts/studio-worker.js` and deploy. Under Settings → Variables and Secrets, add `STRIPE_KEY`, `RESEND_KEY` and `SECRET` (any long random string) as secrets, and `SITE` = `https://channelcrossings.world`, `MAIL_FROM` = `Channel Crossings <studio@channelcrossings.world>`, `PRICE_PENCE` = `199` as text.
4. Put the worker's address (for example `https://studio.yourname.workers.dev`) into `const API` at the top of `studio.js`.
5. Try it with Stripe's test card 4242 4242 4242 4242, any future date and any CVC. Nothing is charged in test mode.
6. When you're happy, swap `STRIPE_KEY` for the live key (`sk_live_…`). Nothing else changes.
