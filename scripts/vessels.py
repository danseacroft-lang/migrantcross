"""Collect the positions of lifeboats, Border Force, coastguard and navy vessels in the Dover Strait.

Runs from .github/workflows/vessels.yml every 15 minutes. Listens to aisstream.io's free live AIS feed for a
couple of minutes, keeps only rescue and government vessels, and writes vessels.json for the map.
Needs the AISSTREAM_KEY secret (free: sign in at aisstream.io with GitHub, then make an API key);
without it the script does nothing.

How a vessel is recognised:
  - its AIS ship type: 51 search and rescue, 55 law enforcement, 35 military
  - or its name: RNLI/RNLB lifeboats, the Gosport lifeboats (GAFIRS: Joan Dora Fuller, Ian Fuller), HMC (Border Force
    cutters), HMS, SNSM (French lifeboats), Abeille (French rescue tugs)
  - or it is a search and rescue aircraft (AIS message 9), such as the coastguard helicopter
A ship's type only comes with its static report (every few minutes), so what we learn is kept in vessels.json and
remembered for 30 days, and a vessel seen once is recognised from its position reports alone afterwards.
